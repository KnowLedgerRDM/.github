## KnowLedger Research Data Management Project

This project focuses on creation of an open ecosystem, KnowLedger, by developing a suite of components needed for an open digital research data management system that will nominally serve all research communities, putting the control of the development in the hands of the research community (as far as possible), promoting data science/informatics as an important part of all research activities, and encouraging research data sharing and reuse.
